Here are descriptions of some projects we have worked on while
studying and working at the 
<a href="https://en.ru.is/scs/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a>
at
<a href="https://en.ru.is/" target="_blank">Reykjavik University</a>.
The projects were done under the supervision of
<a href="http://www.ru.is/kennarar/hannes/" target="_blank">Hannes Högni Vilhjámsson</a>
who leads the
<a href="http://secom.ru.is/" target="_blank">Socially Expressive Computing Group</a>
at the <a href="http://cadia.ru.is/" target="_blank">CADIA</a> research center.

<h1>Character Territoriality: Spatial awareness and navigation (2018)</h1>
<div class="PictureDiv">
	<img src="images/chartermaps.png" />
</div>
<p>
This project is about creating territorial behavior for
virtual people. Ari was working on this project a large part of the year 2018
at the CADIA research center.
This picture shows a scene with some
virtual characters. Special maps are generated based
on the environment and they are used to create navigation
paths for the characters. This project is part of a larger
research project lead by 
<a href="http://claudiopedica.com/" target="_blank">Claudio Pedica</a>.

<h1>Djúpivogur 3D (2018)</h1>
<div class="PictureDiv">
	<img src="images/Djupivogur3D.png" />
</div>
<p>
Research project at CADIA (Reykjavik University) that
Hörður has been working on.
This is a city planning project for a town in Iceland
where virtual reality is used to convey proposed changes
in the city planning. A part of the town of Djúpivogur
as been created and the proposed changes have been added.

This picture and the video below it show an application that Ari
created as part of his masters project.
The application was a virtual reality game for teaching social
skills. The application is described in detail in his
<a href="documents/msc-arith-2018.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a>.
The game has virtual characters whose behavior is based uppon
research in the social sciences on non verbal communication.

<h1>Procedural City (2018)</h1>
<div class="PictureDiv">
	<img src="images/ProcCity1.png" />
</div>
<div class="PictureDiv">
	<img src="images/ProcCity2.png" />
</div>
<p>
Research project at CADIA (Reykjavik University) that
Hörður worked on.
In this project large and very different city
environments can be created with ease (the
click of a button). These environments are
then used to run psychological studies within
virtual reality.

<h1>Vogabyggð 3D (2017)</h1>
<div class="PictureDiv">
	<img src="images/Vogabyggd3D.png" />
</div>
<p>
This is a research project that we worked on at the
CADIA research center.
In this project a replica was made of a particular place in
Iceland to be used in a research study within virtual reality.
Participants would teleport around the virtual environment and
were presented with likert scale questions in the virtual reality
environment.

<h1>Maze VR (2017)</h1>
<div class="PictureDiv">
	<img src="images/MazeHall.png" />
</div>
<div class="PictureDiv">
	<img src="images/MazeUI.png" />
</div>
<p>
This was a small game made for virtual reality by Hörður.
In this game people can freely walk around the corridors of
an endless maze. The virtual environment matches a physical
walking space of 3mx3m, and therefore allowing people to
physically walk around the virtual environment, where as
the usual mode of locomotion is teleportation. This allows
for a much greater immersion and presence within the virtual
environment. When people walk around, the maze environment is
constantly changing giving the illusion that you are going
further and further into the maze. While somebody is navigating
the virtual maze it is possible for another person to sit at a
computer monitor and control certain aspects of the maze experience,
i.e. the lighting and sounds can be affected as well as
doors, props and characters can be controlled.

<h1>Inducing Phobia Response Using Virtual Reality (summer 2016)</h1>
<div class="PictureDiv">

<p>
These screenshot show virtual environments created
for a project during the summer of 2016
at the CADIA
research center.
The purpose of this project was to study the feasibility of
using virtual reality to induce phobia responses.
The study was carried out by the company
<a href="https://www.decode.com/" target="_blank">deCODE genetics</a>.
Five virtual environments were created for five different
phobias which were fear of heights, fear of spiders,
fear of water, fear of sharp objects and 
claustrophobia. The HTC Vive virtual reality headset
was used in the study. The project was nominated
for the
<a href="https://www.rannis.is/frettir/nyskopunarverdlaun-forseta-islands-2017" target="_blank">
Innovation Award of the President of Iceland 2017</a>.
A <a href="documents/VRPhobias-FinalReport-HHV.pdf" target="_blank">final report</a>
describes the project in some detail.
