Here are descriptions of some projects we have worked on while
studying and working at the

<h1>Character Territoriality: Spatial awareness and navigation (2018)</h1>
<div class="PictureDiv">

</div>
<p>
This project is about creating territorial behavior for
virtual people. Ari was working on this project a large part of the year 2018
at the
<a href="http://cadia.ru.is/" target="_blank">CADIA</a> research center.
This picture shows a scene with some
virtual characters. Special maps are generated based
on the environment and they are used to create navigation
paths for the characters. This project is part of a larger
research project lead by 
<a href="http://claudiopedica.com/" target="_blank">Claudio Pedica</a>.

This picture and the video below it show an application that Ari
created as part of his masters project.
His superviser was
<a href="http://www.ru.is/kennarar/hannes/" target="_blank">Hannes Högni Vilhjámsson</a>
The application was a virtual reality game for teaching social
skills. The application is described in detail in his
<a href="documents/msc-arith-2018.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a>.
The game has virtual characters whose behavior is based uppon
research in the social sciences on non verbal communication.

<h1>Inducing Phobia Response Using Virtual Reality (sumer 2016)</h1>
<div class="PictureDiv">
	<img src="images/aquaphobia.png" />
</div>
<p>
This screenshot shows a virtual environment used
for inducing the fear of water.
This is part of a project we worked on during the summer of 2016
at the <a href="http://cadia.ru.is/" target="_blank">CADIA</a>
research center.
Our superviser during the project was
<a href="http://www.ru.is/kennarar/hannes/" target="_blank">Hannes Högni Vilhjámsson</a>
who leads the
<a href="http://secom.ru.is/" target="_blank">Socially Expressive Computing Group</a>.
The purpose of this project was to study the feasibility of
using virtual reality to induce phobia responses.
The study was carried out by the company
<a href="https://www.decode.com/" target="_blank">deCODE genetics</a>.
Five virtual environments were created for five different
phobias which were fear of heights, fear of spiders,
fear of water, fear of sharp objects and 
claustrophobia. The HTC Vive virtual reality headset
was used in the study. The project was nominated
for the
<a href="https://www.rannis.is/frettir/nyskopunarverdlaun-forseta-islands-2017" target="_blank">
Innovation Award of the President of Iceland 2017</a>.
A <a href="documents/VRPhobias-FinalReport-HHV.pdf" target="_blank">final report</a>
describes the project in some detail.
